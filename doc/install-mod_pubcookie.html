                  <h4><a name="overview">Overview</a></h4>

                  <p>This guide helps Apache HTTP server administrators install and use the Pubcookie Apache
                     module, herein referred to as simply <i>the module</i>, but also commonly known
                     as mod_pubcookie.</p>
                  <p>The topics covered below will help you to :</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p>Build and install the module for use with either Apache 1.3 or 2.0;</p></li>
                    <li><p>Use the Pubcookie keyclient to obtain a symmetric encryption key from your
                      local Pubcookie keyserver and retrieve your site's Pubcookie "granting" certificate;</p></li>
                    <li><p>Configure the module by adding directives to Apache's httpd.conf;</p></li>
                    <li><p>Start Apache and test the module to confirm that authentication is working.</p></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Site administrators should refer to the <a href="install-login.html">login server guide</a> 
                  for instructions on deploying a Pubcookie login server.</p>

                  <h4><a name="new">What's New</a></h4>

                  <p>Significant improvements and changes included in Pubcookie 3.3.2c:</p>

                  <ul>
                  <li>Fixed bug in use of output filters introduced in version 3.3.2, in
                  Apache 2.0.49 and higher, whereby headers set in the 'filter' mode are 
                  dropped when the module creates response content, logouts, errors, etc.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Significant improvements and changes included in Pubcookie 3.3.2b:</p>

                  <ul>
                  <li>Modified Apache module to handle '+' chars in base-64-encoded path.
                  This fixes possible truncations of uri's sent through the login process.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Significant improvements and changes included in Pubcookie 3.3.2a:</p>

                  <ul>
                  <li>Modified Apache module to verify that the login server sends a
                  non-empty userid in the granting reply, unless PubcookieNoPrompt
                  is on.</li>
                  <li>Modifed Apache module to url-encode '+' chars after base64-encoding
                  query strings. This fixes possible truncations of uri's sent through
                  the login process.</li>
                  <li>Fixed out of place "char *datestr" declaration.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Significant improvements and changes included in Pubcookie 3.3.2:</p>

                  <ul>
                  <li>Improved Apache 2.x compatibility. For Apache 2.0.49 and above, the module sets output
                  headers in an output filter. This provides better interoperability with other modules too,
                  in particular, mod_proxy_ajp.</li>
                  <li>Added <a href="mod_pubcookie-directives.html#PubcookieNoCleanCreds">PubcookieNoCleanCreds</a> directive 
                  to allows an application to handle flavor_getcred credential cleanup.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Significant improvements and changes included in Pubcookie 3.3.1:</p>

                  <ul>
                  <li>Added <a href="mod_pubcookie-directives.html#PubcookieCatenateAppIDs">PubcookieCatenateAppIDs</a> directive</li>
                  <li>Improved Makefile for Apache 2.2 builds.</li>
                  <li>Modified session reauthentication messaging. The module now verifies that the login cgi handled a reauthentication request
                      when session reauthentication is configured. (Requires 3.3.1 or higher login server.)
                  <li>Fixed bug in AES encryption mode that causes session cookies to be unreadable when PubcookieInactiveExpire
                      is on. </li>
                  <li>Modified the module's startup process such that it halts if security initialization fails (e.g.,
                      PubcookieSessionCertFile doesn't exist).</li>

                  </ul>

                  <p>Significant improvements and changes included in Pubcookie 3.3.0a:</p>

                  <ul>
                  <li>Fixed encryption problems found with some virtual host configurations.</li>
                  <li>Modified POST <a href="mod_pubcookie-directives.html#PubcookieLoginMethod">PubcookieLoginMethod</a> 
                  to use HTTP 302 redirects instead of meta-refresh on redirect back to the resource.</li>
                  <li>Updated the module's handling of output values when printing redirect pages.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Significant improvements and changes included in Pubcookie 3.3.0:</p>

                  <ul>

                  <li>Added AES encryption as the default encryption algorithm requested by and used by the module.
                  To interoperate with earlier versions of the login server, set 
                  <a href="mod_pubcookie-directives.html#PubcookieEncryption">PubcookieEncryption</a>
                  to DES or build the module with the <tt>--enable-default-des</tt> configure option.</li>
                  <li>Removed pre-session cookie countermeasure when using POST
                  <a href="mod_pubcookie-directives.html#PubcookieLoginMethod">PubcookieLoginMethod</a>. 
                  It's unneeded complexity and in this case an unnecessary countermeasure.</li>
                  <li>Added <a href="#wildcard">wildcard subdomain key</a> capability for large multi-user 
                  web-hosting environments.</li>
                  <li>Better handling of stray, malicious, and other spurious cookies.  
                  The module will read all available session, pre-session, and granting cookies, until it
                  finds a valid one. Previously it only checked the first one, which may be invalid.</li>

                  </ul>

                  <p>See <tt>doc/CHANGES.txt</tt> for bug fixes and other improvements.</p> 

                  <h4><a name="compatibility">Compatibility Notes</a></h4>

                  <p>Here are some compatibility notes for version 3.3:</p>

                  <dl>

                  <dt>Compatibility note on version 3.3 encryption algorithms:
                  <dd>The version 3.3 module supports different encryption algorithms. AES encryption is the default.
                  However, earlier versions of the login server only support one algorithm, DES, so you will have to determine the
                  version of your login server and configure the <a
                  href="mod_pubcookie-directives.html#PubcookieEncryption">PubcookieEncryption</a> directive accordingly.
  
                  <dt>Compatibility note on version 3.1 relays:
                  <dd>The need for the cgi-based relays introduced in version 3.1 to authenticate across DNS domains was redressed
                  by the POST-based messaging method introduced in version 3.2. <strong>Use of third-party 3.1
                  relays has therefore been deprecated.</strong> A third-party relay is any relay not hosted on the same server that requests
                  authentication. Application servers using third-party relays are strongly encouraged to upgrade to version 3.2 or
                  higher and use the POST-based messaging method.

                  </dl>

                  <h4><a name="upgrading">Upgrading</a></h4>

                  <p>In general (note exceptions below) upgrading a working installation of the module requires very few, if any,
                  changes to the current Apache configuration, and you can typically reuse your current Pubcookie granting
                  certificate and symmetric encryption key too.</p>

                  <p>Here are some compatibility notes for upgrading between specific versions:</p>

                  <dl>

                  <dt>Upgrading from version 3.0/3.1/3.2 to 3.3:

                  <dd>Apache servers being upgraded from version 3.0/3.1/3.2 to version 3.3 should be aware that <strong>version 3.3
                  expects and uses AES encryption by default.</strong> If your login server is version 3.3 or higher,
                  interoperability isn't a concern. However, to interoperate with earlier version of login server, you should configure
                  <a href="mod_pubcookie-directives.html#PubcookieEncryption">PubcookieEncryption</a> to use DES encryption,
                  or, if you don't want to make any Apache configuration changes, you should build the module using the
                  <tt>--enable-default-des</tt> configure option, which forces the module to use DES encryption by default.

                  <p>If your login server is version 3.3 higher and therefore allows you to use AES encryption, you should note that
                  session cookies encrypted with DES cannot be unencrypted with AES.  As a result, pre-session and session cookies
                  obtained by users prior to upgrading the module will be invalid after the upgrade. Therefore, some users will be
                  redirected through the login server to establish a new session.</p>

                  <p>Clustered hosts should be upgraded with special care to keep all cluster members using the same encryption
                  method.</p>

                  <p>Note: You do not have to request a new encryption key to use version 3.3. Your current host key works equally
                  well for AES and DES encryption.</p>

                  <dt>Upgrading from version 1.77 to 3.3:

                  <dd>Apache servers being upgraded from earlier versions of the module (classic versions, such as version 1.77) 
                  may require minor configuration changes. Review the <a href="#config">Apache configuration</a> section closely.
                  Also review the sections on <a href="#vhosts">virtual host configuration</a> and <a href="#cluster">clustered host
                  configuration</a> if they apply to your environment.</p>

                  <p>Apache servers being upgraded from earlier versions should also be aware of the switch to AES encryption noted
                  in the section above.</p>

                  <p>Also recall that version 1.77 requires an encryption key specific to your primary IP address. If you want to be
                  able to rollback to version 1.77 more easily, you should keep your current key intact on your server as well as
                  on your site's Pubcookie login server. To do so, use the keyclient's <tt>-d</tt> option when downloading
                  the current key; otherwise the keyserver will generate a new one that isn't compatible with version 1.77.

                  </dl>

                  <h4><a name="pre">Prerequisites</a></h4>

                  <p>The module relies on additional infrastructure at your site.
                  Here are some general prerequisites that,  if fulfilled, will lead
                  to a smooth, successful installation.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> 
                      <p>Determine the location of your site's Pubcookie login server. You'll need this URL to configure 
                        the module. You may also want to find out its version, for <a href="#upgrading">compatibility</a> reasons, 
                        and to know what features it supports.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Determine the location of your site's Pubcookie keyserver. You'll need this URL to request a 
                        symmetric encryption key that your server will share with your login server. Depending on the keyserver 
                        version and site policy, you may also need to ask your administrator to "permit" your server to request
                        keys.</p>
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                      <p>Determine how trust is handled by your site's Pubcookie keyserver. You'll need to know which
                        Certificate Authorities the keyserver trusts to verify certificates. Similarly, 
                        you'll need to know which Certificate Authority can verify the keyserver's certificate. Ask your
                        administrator for guidelines; it'll save you time and effort.</p>
                    </li> 

                    <li> 
                      <p>Determine how your site distributes its Pubcookie "granting" certificate.
                        You'll need a copy of this certificate to verify the "granting" cookies signed and sent by 
                        your site's login server. You may be able to download it from your keyserver, or you
                        may have to obtain it manually. Ask your administrator which method to use.</p>
                    </li> 
                  </ul>

                  <p>Note: one additional suggestion for more advanced uses. Review the sections on
                    <a href="#vhosts">virtual host configuration</a> or <a href="#clusters">clustered host 
                    configuration</a> now if either of those scenarios apply. The information will help you think 
                    about and tailor the simple case instructions while you go through them.</p>

                  <h4><a name="req">System Requirements</a></h4>

                  <p>The module has the following system requirements:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p>Unix platform.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Accurate system time.</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a> library.</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> HTTP Server. Versions 1.3 and 2.0.49 
                      and above are supported.</p></li>
                    <li><p>SSL enabled web server. The <a href="http://www.modssl.org">mod_ssl</a> 
                      package is recommended. See our <a href="http://www.pubcookie.org/faq.html">FAQ</a>
                      for information about using Apache-SSL.</p></li>
                    <li><p>SSL keypair. An SSL server certificate and private key.</p>
                      <p>Note: Pubcookie uses elements of public-key infrastructure (PKI) for
                      server authentication and data privacy. Therefore, as you might expect, your 
                      SSL server certificate and private key can play a role here. However, a
                      self-signed certificate may not pass muster.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Domain name registered in DNS (e.g. <i>appserver.example.edu</i>) .</p>
                      </p>Note: If your server doesn't share a common DNS subdomain 
                      (e.g. <i>.example.edu</i>) with
                      your site's Pubcookie login server (e.g. <i>weblogin.example.edu</i>)
                      or if your enterprise DNS domain is in a country code top-level domain
                      (e.g. <i>example.ca</i>) then you should use POST-based messaging configured by the
                      <a href="mod_pubcookie-directives.html#PubcookieLoginMethod">PubcookieLoginMethod</a>.</p></li>
                  </ul>

                  <!-- build and install sections -->

                  <h4><a name="ssl">Confirm SSL Support</a></h4>

                  <p>Before you build and install the module, confirm that your SSL configuration
                    is working and that Apache responds to HTTPS requests.  The module requires a functioning
                    SSL-enabled server.</p>
                  <p>If your Apache server does not already support SSL, refer to <a href="#A">Appendix A: How to
                    Enable SSL</a> for guidelines.</p>

                  <h4><a name="build">Build &amp; Install</a></h4>

                  <p>The <tt>configure</tt> script included in the distribution helps you 
                    build and install the module according to your platform, Apache version,
                    and individual preferences. It also helps you build and install the
                    Pubcookie keyclient which will be used to obtain a symmetric encryption key for

                        2.0) to copy the DSO to Apache's modules (libexec) directory. With Apache 1.3, it also adds

		  <h4><a name="keyclient">Run Keyclient</a></h4>

                  <p>Pubookie solves the problem of securely distributing symmetric encryption keys by 
                    introducing a keyserver. Participating servers make authenticated SSL/TLS connections to 
                    keyserver to obtain a host key. This section describes how to configure and run the
                    Pubcookie keyclient utility to request keys from your local keyserver.</p>

                  <p>Tip: Ask your keyserver administrator for advice about configuring the keyclient. It's
                    particularly important to know the Certificate Authority that signed (and therefore can 
                    verify) the keyserver's certificate.</p>

                  <p><b>To configure the keyclient:</b></p>

                    <li> 
                      <p>The keyclient accepts command-line options, but it's generally easier
                        to configure by specifying values in a separate text configuration file. Go ahead and create one now:</p>

                    </table></p>
                    <p>Note: keyclient uses a built-in location, based on your original installation prefix,
                      to look for a config file and to store host keys. Adjust the path above accordingly.</p>

                  <h4><a name="config"></a>Configuration (httpd.conf)</h4>

                  <p>Configuring the module begins with your main Apache server configuration 
                    httpd.conf file.  This section describes what you need to add to this file.</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li> 
                      <p>Edit your Apache server configuration file (httpd.conf), 
                        e.g.:</p>

                      <p>(For DSO method only.) When working with the module as a DSO, the installation process
                        uses <tt>apxs</tt></a> (Apache 1.3) or <tt>libtool</tt> (Apache 2.0) to install the module
                        into Apache's modules (libexec) directory. Now the module needs a little configuration
                        based on your version of Apache.</p>
                      <p><b>Apache 1.3: LoadModule &amp; AddModule</b><br>
                        With Apache 1.3, installation also
                        adds new, but initially inactive, LoadModule and AddModule directives to your httpd.conf file.
                        Find these directives. Make sure they landed in the right location.
                        And uncomment them to activate them. For example:</p>
                      <p>

                      <p><b>Apache 2.0: LoadModule</b><br>
                        With Apache 2.0, add a <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_so.html#loadmodule">LoadModule</a> 
                        directive to your server config wherever it makes sense to do so. The AddModule directive

                        <p>These are recommended configuration directives, but they're not all required to
                        initialize the module. It's a good exercise, however, to configure them explicitly,
                        so you know what's going on.</p>

                        defines the encryption algorithm used by the module. Since the module chooses the algorithm
                        that the login server will use to encrypt messages, it's important to get this one correct.
                        (See <a href="#compatibility">compatibility notes</a>.)</p>

                        the messaging method used by the module. Servers in country code top-level domains (e.g. 
                        <i>.ca</i>, <i>.de</i>) must use the <tt>POST</tt> method.</p>

                        just happens to be what they use at Example State University.) Each type you define should 
                        correspond with a "login flavor" offered by your login server. Most sites have just one.</p>

                        signed as often when there is no inactivity timeout. Applications that require an inactivity 
                        timeout can always override the default setting.</p>

                        can be made readable only by root. If you start Apache as a non-root user,
                        then that user must be able to read the supporting file.</p>

                  <h4><a name="logout">Logout Configuration and Use</a></h4>

                  <p>The <a href="mod_pubcookie-directives.html#PubcookieEndSession">PubcookieEndSession</a> 
                  directive causes the module to clear the current session cookie. Therefore, it can be used 
                  to implement application logout.</p>

                  <p>Logout can be configured on a per-application
                  basis using .htaccess or centrally using a virtual logout
                  URI that any application on the server can use.</p>

                  <p><b>To configure logout using .htaccess:</b><br />
                  The simplest way to configure logout for an application or static website
                  is to place a .htaccess file in a subdirectory (e.g. <tt>logout</tt>) and put a 
                  PubcookieEndSession in the .htaccess file. It might be laid out something like
                  this:</p>
                  <p> 
                  <TABLE BGCOLOR="#E0E5F5" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="5">
                    <TR> 
                      <TD><pre>$ ls -a
.htaccess    images/    index.php    other.php    logout/
$ more .htaccess
PubcookieAppID testapp
Authtype EGNetID
require valid-user
$ more logout/.htaccess
PubcookieEndSession redirect</pre></TD>
                    </TR>
                  </TABLE></p>
                  <p>Then a link from any page to the subdirectory will steer users to logout, 
                  allowing PubcookieEndSession to do its work.</p>
                  <p> 
                  <TABLE BGCOLOR="#E0E5F5" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="5">
                    <TR> 
                      <TD><pre>&lt;a href="logout/"&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt;</pre></TD>
                    </TR>
                  </TABLE></p>

                  <p><b>To configure and use a matching logout URI:</b><br />
                  This is a nice alternative for system administrators and application deployers who 
                  prefer not to use subdirectories and .htaccess files to configure
                  logout. Essentially, by using Apache's <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#locationmatch">LocationMatch</a> 
                  directive you can create a server-wide matching string that causes the module to
                  invoke <a href="mod_pubcookie-directives.html#PubcookieEndSession">PubcookieEndSession</a> 
                  without the use of .htaccess.
                  Simply by creating a link with the same string in it, an application 
                  can implement logout.</p>

                  <p>Here's example httpd.conf configuration which defines
                  two such strings, <tt>LOGOUT-REDIRECT</tt> and <tt>LOGOUT-CLEARLOGIN</tt>,
                  corresponding with two styles of application logout provided by Pubcookie.</p>
                  <p> 
                  <TABLE BGCOLOR="#E0E5F5" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="5">
                    <TR> 
                          <TD> <pre>&lt;IfDefine HAVE_SSL&gt;

PubcookieEndSession redirect
&lt;/LocationMatch>

&lt;LocationMatch .*/LOGOUT-CLEARLOGIN.*&gt;
AuthType EGNetID
require valid-user
PubcookieEndSession clearLogin
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;

&lt;/IfModule mod_pubcookie.c&gt;
&lt;/IfDefine&gt;</pre></TD>
                    </TR>
                  </TABLE>
                  </p>
                  <p>With these directives in place, and the server restarted, any Pubcookie-protected application
                  or static website on the server can create a logout function simply by linking to one of 
                  these virtual URIs. For example:</p>
                  <p> 
                  <TABLE BGCOLOR="#E0E5F5" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="5">

                      <TD><pre>&lt;a href="LOGOUT-REDIRECT"&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt;</pre></TD>
                    </TR>
                  </TABLE></p>

<h4><a name="relay">Cross-Domain Relay Configuration</a></h4>

<p>Authentication across DNS domains was greatly simplified in Pubcookie 3.2.0
with the addition of the POST-based 
<a href="mod_pubcookie-directives.html#PubcookieLoginMethod">PubcookieLoginMethod</a>.

<h4><a name="vhosts">Virtual Host Configuration</a></h4>

<p>One approach to configuring separate virtual hosts on the same system
is to use your main server configuration section to establish default settings
for Pubcookie, as described in the <a href="#config">Configuration</a> section
above. Then override directives as needed for each virtual host.</p>

<p>For example, a separate session keypair should be used for each 
virtual host, which you can do by defining different
<a href="mod_pubcookie-directives.html#PubcookieSessionKeyFile">PubcookieSessionKeyFile</a>
and <a href="mod_pubcookie-directives.html#PubcookieSessionCertFile">PubcookieSessionCertFile</a>
directives within your virtual host configuration. It may be acceptable to use defaults
for the module's other configuration settings.</p>

<p>To request a symmetric encryption key for each virtual server name, 
you can use your current config file to define default values and then 
override them using command-line options for each virtual host's SSL private 
key and certificate files. For example:</p>

<pre>$ ./keyclient -k vhost.key -c vhost.crt
Set crypt key for vhost.example.edu</pre>

<p>You can also set up a config file for each virtual host and use the
keyclient's <tt>-f filename</tt> to point to each separately.</p>

<h4><a name="clusters">Clustered Host Configuration</a></h4>

<p>System administrators frequently cluster together several hosts 
for better redundancy, performance, stability, and recoverability. Each 
host in the cluster is configured the same, so each has a SSL certificate 
and private key identical to the other cluster members.</p>

<p>For instance, a site might have 15 webmail servers named 
<i>webmail1.example.edu</i> through <i>webmail15.example.edu</i>
with 15 unique IP addresses. As cluster peers, they're each equipped
with the same SSL keypair for <i>webmail.example.edu</i>. A load-based DNS rotary 
or Cisco Load Director might control the IP address for the
<i>webmail.example.edu</i> name itself.</p>

<p>To support such a cluster, use <tt>keyclient</tt> on one host,
say <i>webmail1.example.edu</i>, to generate a <tt>webmail.example.edu</tt> 
host key. Then use <tt>keyclient -d</tt> on all other webmail hosts
to download the existing host key to the remaining servers.
This way, they all use the same key.</p>

<h4><a name="wildcard">Wildcard Subdomain Key Configuration</a></h4>

<p>Wildcard subdomain configuration allows the module to reuse
a single host key file for protecting several server names in
the same subdomain. For example, it allows a single <i>students.example.edu</i> host key
to function as the encryption key for all the individual
student web sites (<i>abe.students.example.edu</i>, <i>bess.students.example.edu</i>,
<i>spud.example.edu</i>, etc.) as might happen on a large
multi-user web-hosting environment.</p>

<p>It works like this: the actual key for AES encryption 
is a randomly chosen 128 bits from the host key file. To allow 
the same host key file to encrypt cookies for all subdomains 
the wildcard-subdomain encryption mode augments the usual 128 bits with the 
requested web site's full domain name. The key becomes 
<i>SHA1( (128 bits from file) + (web site's full domain name) )</i>.
When the module fails to find a key for the requested web site's
full domain name, it will look again with the first part of the
name removed, i.e. for a key representing a wildcard for the 
subdomain.</p>

<p>This feature is enabled by setting the 
<a href="mod_pubcookie-directives.html#PubcookieEncryption">PubcookieEncryption</a> 
directive to <tt>AES+DOMAIN</tt> and requires that Apache's
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#usecanonicalname">UseCanonicalName</a>
directive is turned off.</p>

<h4><a name="debug">Troubleshooting</a></h4>

<p>To troubleshoot problems with keyclient, review the error messages
it produces. If need be, ask your keyserver administrator to review 
syslog for keyserver error messages corresponding with your keyclient 
connections.</p>

<p>To troubleshoot problems with the module, first look in the Apache
error_log. If need be you can log additional debug statements by
setting the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#loglevel">LogLevel</a>
to <tt>debug</tt> in your httpd.conf file.</p>

<h4><a name="A">Appendix A: How to Enable SSL</a></h4>

<p>Note: This is just an overview; 
you'll have to look elsewhere for specific instructions if 
you need them. (The INSTALL file that comes with mod_ssl is
particularly good.)</p>

<ol>

<li> 
<p>Build and install OpenSSL.</p>

<li> 

<p>Build and install Apache from source and add SSL support by
following the directions accompanying the mod_ssl package. You will
have to decide whether to build modules dynamically or statically. If
you use apxs (the Apache DSO module builder), be sure to link it with
OpenSSL.</p>

<li> 

<p>Generate a RSA private key and certificate signing request (CSR) to
obtain a signed SSL server certificate. Install the private key and
server certificate as directed by the mod_ssl documentation.</p>

<p>Note: You may end up reusing this keypair with the keyclient
utility, in which case your certificate should be issued by a
Certificate Authority trusted by your keyserver. And your private key
should be readable without having to enter a passphrase to decrypt
it.</p>

<li> 

<p>Verify that Apache responds to HTTPS requests. SSL should be working
before you proceed to build and install the module.</p>

</ol>

<h4><a name="B">Appendix B: Configuration For Abbreviated Domain Names</a></h4>

<p>Because HTTP cookies must be scoped to a specific fully-qualified 
domain, the use of abbreviated domain names (e.g. "<em>appserver</em>" 
instead of "<em>appserver.example.edu</em>") affects the sending 
of cookies, which in turn affects, and causes problems for, 
Pubcookie.</p>

<p>To remedy this, you might use <a
href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a> to rewrite 
(and redirect) abbreviated domain names to fully-qualified 
domain names. Here is a sample configuration (for httpd.conf):</p>

<p> 
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#E0E5F5" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="5">
<TR> 
<TD> <pre>RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^$
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !\.example\.edu
RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [L,R]</pre></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</p>
                  
<p>This rule is for a https requests only; you would need something 
similar for http requests. You may also need to add additional 
rules for subdomains (e.g. <i>subdomain.example.edu</i>). 
Additionally, abbreviated domain names must be in your ServerAlias 
list.</p>

</ol>
