<h4><a name="overview">Overview</a></h4>

<p>This guide helps Microsoft IIS server administrators install the
Pubcookie ISAPI filter, herein referred to as simply <i>the
filter</i>.</p>

<h4><a name="news">What's New</a></h4>

<p>TBD</p>

<h4><a name="prereq">Prerequisites</a></h4>

<p>The filter relies on additional infrastructure at your site. Here are
some general prerequisites that, if fulfilled, will lead to a smooth,
successful installation.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Determine the location of your site's Pubcookie login server.  The
installer needs this URL during installation. You may also want to find
out its version, so that you know what features it supports.</p></li>

<li><p>Determine the location of your site's Pubcookie keyserver. The
installer needs this URL to request a symmetric encryption key that your
server will share with your login server. Depending on the keyserver
version and site policy, you may also need to ask your administrator to
"permit" your server to request keys.</p></li>

<li><p>Determine how trust is handled by your site's Pubcookie keyserver.
You'll need to know which Certificate Authorities the keyserver trusts to
verify certificates. Similarly, you'll need to know which Certificate
Authority can verify the keyserver's certificate. Ask your administrator
for guidelines; it'll save you time and effort.</p></li>

<li><p>Determine how your site distributes its Pubcookie "granting" 
certificate. The installer needs a copy of this certificate to verify the
"granting" cookies signed and sent by your site's login server. The
installer may be able to download it from your keyserver, or you may have
to obtain it manually. Ask your administrator which method to
use.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Note: Review the sections on <a href="vhost">virtual host
configuration</a> or <a href="clusters">clustered host configuration</a>
now if either of those scenarios apply. The information will help you
think about and tailor the installation as needed.</p>

<h4><a name="sysreq">System Requirements</a></h4>

<p>The Pubcookie ISAPI filter has the following system requirements:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Microsoft Windows ???? or later</p></li>

<li><p>Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 or later</p></li>

<li><p>Accurate system time</p></li>

<li><p>SSL enabled Web site. All intended users should be able to 
reach your website via HTTPS.</p></li>

<li><p>SSL private key and server certifiate. The certificate should be
signed by a CA trusted by your site's keyserver. Should be installed in
your Personal Certificate Store and associated with your website server
name.</p></li>

<li><p>Domain name registered in DNS (e.g. <i>appserver.example.edu</i>). 
Should be the same server name as the Common Name field of your SSL
certificate.</p>

<p>Note: If your server doesn't share a common DNS subdomain (e.g. 
<i>.example.edu</i>) with your site's Pubcookie login server (e.g. 
<i>weblogin.example.edu</i>) or if your enterprise DNS domain is 
in a country code top-level domain  (e.g. <i>example.ca</i>) you will 
have to install and use the Pubcookie relay cgi to authenticate 
across DNS domains.</p>

<p>Note: a host file can work for testing, but production systems need
enterprise dns.</p>

<li><p>The <tt>System32\Inetsrv</tt> folder should be world writable or 
writable by the administrator account running the installer.</p></li>

</ul>

<h4><a name="install">InstallShield Wizard for Pubcookie</a></h4>

<p>Run the InstallShield Wizard for Pubcookie as the administrator user or
as an account with administrator privileges. The installer needs to create
folders and files in the <tt>System32\Inetsrv</tt> folder as well as to
stop and start system services.</p>

<p>In a typical installation, the Wizard will:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Allow you to install Pubcookie, or to modify, repair, or 
remove Pubcookie if it is already installed.</p></li>

<li><p>Collect Site Information. Here you'll be able to specify your 
server name, Pubcookie login server and keyserver locations, 
enterprise domain, and authentication types.</p></li>

<li><p>Select the ISAPI Filter and basic test Webapp for 
installation.</p></li>

<li><p>Do the install. Here the installer will add the Pubcookie filter to
the IIS root filter list and restart IIS services. It will aslo use your
server name to locate your SSL key pair from the Personal Certificate
store and use them, along with your installed Certificate Authority
certificates, to negotiate a symmetric key from your keyserver and
download your site's "granting" certificate.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>Note: to request a key from your keyserver you may have to ask your 
keyserver administrator to "permit" your host. Also, you'll need to be 
able to verify the keyserver's SSL certificate with the CA certificates 
installed on your system. Ask your keyserver administrator if you need a 
special CA certificate to do that.</p>

<p>Note: to protect the server's symmetric encryption key, the installer
will remove <i>everyone</i> permission to this file; no other accounts 
except the IIS 4/5/6 iuser account needs to read this key.</p>

<p>[fixme: does the installer prompt for a granting cert if it can't be 
retrieved from the keyserver?]</p>

<h4><a name="clusters">Clustered Host Configuration</a></h4>

<p>For clustered host configurations, run the installer on each host.
After running the install on the last host, copy the symmetric key (from
<tt>System32\Inetsrv\Pubcookie\keys\</tt>) on the last host to each of the
other hosts. This will syncronize the cluster with the key stored on the
login server.</p>

<h4><a name="vhosts">Virtual Host Configuration</a></h4>

<p>TBD.</p>

<h4><a name="relay">Cross-Domain Relay Configuration</a></h4>

<p>TBD.</p>

<h4><a name="upgrade">Upgrading</a></h4>

<p>For the cleanest upgrade from an earlier version of Pubcookie:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Stop IIS.</p></li>

<li><p>Remove your existing 
<tt>System32\Inetsrv\Pubcookie</tt> folder.</p></li>

<li><p>Run the InstallShield Wizard for Pubcookie 3.1</p></li>

</ol>

<p>Note: the installer won't overwrite the web properties (registry 
settings) you've assigned to your website, folders, or resources. It 
will update the filter variables according to the login server and 
keyserver URLs you provide to the installer.</p>
