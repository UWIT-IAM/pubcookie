		<h4><a name="overview">Overview</a></h4>

		<p>This guide helps Microsoft Internet Information Server administrators 
		to install, configure and use the Pubcookie 3.3 ISAPI filter, herein referred to as, 
		simply, <i>the filter</i>.</p>

		<p>The filter controls user authentication. When a resource is
		protected with a Pubcookie authentication type, access to the resource is controlled by
		the filter and users must be able to get through the authentication process before
		IIS can serve the requested resource. The filter sets a <tt>HTTP_PUBCOOKIE_USER</tt> 
		server variable containing the user's id when authentication is successful.

		<p>The filter does not provide authorization; it's up to the resource/application to 
		decide what the authenticated user is privileged to do.</p>

		<h4><a name="news">What's New</a></h4>

                <p>Significant changes in Pubcookie 3.3.2c:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p><b>Rebuilt PubcookieFilter DLL using OpenSSL 0.9.7f libraries.</b> 
                    This fixes signature verify problems with multi-threading on multi-CPU 
                    IIS servers.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Significant changes in Pubcookie 3.3.2b:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p><b>Improved handling of odd characters in path and query strings.</b> 
                    The filter now matches the Apache module's handling of odd characters in 
                    the requested uri's path and query; this fixes possible truncation of uri's
                    sent through the login process.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Verify non-empty userid.</b> Modified the ISAPI filter to disallow
                    empty userids in the granting reply unless the No_Prompt setting is on.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Significant changes in Pubcookie 3.3.1:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p><b>Fixed duplicate HTTP header values.</b> Replaced AddHeader() with SetHeader() in the ISAPI filter
                    to eliminate duplicate HTTP Header values. </p></li>

                    <li><p><b>Modified session reauthenticaiton messaging.</b> The filter now verifies that the login cgi handled a
                    reauthentication request when session reauthentication is configured. (Requires 3.3.1 or higher login server.)</p></li>

                </ul>

                <p>Significant changes in Pubcookie 3.3.0a:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p><b>Changed redirection method.</b> Modified extension to use HTTP 302 redirects instead
                    of meta-refresh on redirect back to the resource. Also updated the handling of output values
                    when printing redirect pages.</p></li>

                    <li><p><b>Dumpvars.asp removed.</b> The dumpvars.asp file was removed from the sample web application.</p></li>
                </ul>
		
		<p>Significant changes in version 3.3.0:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><b>Added AES encryption support.</b> AES is now the default encryption algorithm requested by and
                                used by the filter to encrypt and decrypt private data. To interoperate with earlier versions of the
                                login server, use the IIS Manager to set the new Encryption Method directive to DES for your web
                                site.</p>
			<li>
				<p><b>Removed pre-session cookie countermeasure.</b> Unneeded complexity and, as it turns out, an
                                unnecessary countermeasure when messages are communicated using HTTP POST message bodies as they've
                                been since the 3.2 release.
			<li>
				<p><b>Fixed AppID display in MMC snap-in.</b> The Pubcookie Directives tab displays the correct default,
                                inherited, or explicitly applied AppId setting that is being used by the ISAPI filter itself.
			<li>
				<p><b>Removed Enterprise_Domain directive from MMC extension.</b> Obsolete since the 3.2 release.

		</ul>

		<p>Significant changes in version 3.2:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><b>PubcookieFilter DLL now acts as an ISAPI extension
                                as well as an ISAPI filter.</b> As before, the filter manages access to
                                resources and initiates authentication. The extension has been added to
                                consume replies from the login server. Together, they implement the
                                POST-based login method introduced in the Pubcookie 3.2.0 Apache module.
                                This change effectively replaces the classic enterprise-cookie-based method 
                                used in the past. As a result, Enterprise_Domain has been removed from the 
                                installer, and the relay cgi has been removed altogether.
			<li>
				<p><b>Updated Windows Installer package (Pubcookie.msi).</b> Site Information 
                                screen now provides 3 keyclient options: obtain new key, retrieve old key,
                                or don't run keyclient at all. Also, the installer now continues after 
                                keyclient errors rather than rolling back; this allows you to troubleshoot 
                                and then re-run the keyclient manually to obtain granting certificate and 
                                encryption key.
			<li>
				<p><b>Enhanced Keyclient.exe.</b> When run manually, it offers a certificate picker to 
                                choose among multiple valid certificates.
			<li>
				<p><b>Fixed problems reading registry settings.</b> The filter is more consistent about
				reading and applying default configuration, as well as configuration defined through 
				alternate WebVarLocations. The related bugs in version 3.1.1 have been fixed.
			<li>
				<p><b>Updated Cache-control headers.</b> The Pubcookie filter matches the Apache module's
				headers for redirections to the login server.</b>
			<li>
				<p><b>Favicon location exempted.</b> Fixes problems with some browsers, especially
				Firefox, when the favicon is protected.
			<li>
				<p><b>Updated OpenSSL 0.9.7.f libraries.</b>
			<li>
				<p><b>Other bug fixes and improved memory management.</b>

		</ul>

		<h4><a name="compatibility">Compatibility</a></h4>

                <p>Here are some compatibility notes for version 3.3:</p>

                <dl>

                <dt>Compatibility note on version 3.3 encryption options:</dt>
                <dd>The version 3.3 filter supports different encryption algorithms. AES encryption is the default. However, earlier
                versions of the login server only support one algorithm, DES, so you will have to determine the version of your
                login server and set the Encryption Method directive accordingly. It may make the most sense to do this at the
                web site level.

		<p><img src="images/encryption.jpg">

                <dt>Upgrading from version 3.0/3.1/3.2 to 3.3:</dt>
                <dd>Servers being upgraded from version 3.0/3.1/3.2 to version 3.3 should be aware that version 3.3 expects and uses
                AES encryption by default. If your login server is version 3.3 or higher there is no concern; it supports
                authentication requests that ask for AES encrypted replies. However, to interoperate with earlier versions of the
                login server, you must set the Encryption Method directive to use DES encryption for your web site. This will ensure
                that your upgraded filter continues to use DES encryption. 

                <p>If your login server is version 3.3 higher and therefore allows you to use AES encryption, you should note that
                session cookies encrypted with DES cannot be unencrypted with AES. As a result, session cookies obtained by users
                prior to upgrading the module will be invalid after the upgrade. This means some users will be redirected through
                the login server to establish a new session.</p>

                <p>Clustered hosts should be upgraded with special care to keep all cluster members using the same encryption
                method.</p>

                <p>Note: You do not have to request a new encryption key to use version 3.3. Your current host key works equally
                well for AES and DES encryption.</p>

                <dt>Upgrading from version 2.7 to 3.3:</dt>
                <dd>Servers being upgraded from earlier versions of the filter (classic versions, such as version 2.7) may require
                configuration changes. Extra care should be given to reviewing that authentication is working as expected after the
                upgrade. Also review the sections on <a href="#vhosts">multiple web site configuration</a> and <a
                href="#clusters">clustered host configuration</a> if they apply to your environment.

                <p>Servers being upgraded from earlier versions should also be aware of the switch to AES encryption noted in the
                compatibility notes above.</p>

                <p>Also recall that version 2.7 requires an encryption key specific to your primary IP address. If you want to be
                able to rollback to version 2.7 more easily, you should keep your current key intact on your server as well as on
                your site's Pubcookie login server. To do so, select the option to retrieve your old key when working through the
                installer; otherwise it will obtain a new key from the keyserver, one that isn't compatible with version 2.7.</p>

                </dl>

		<h4><a name="prereq">Prerequisites</a></h4>

		<p>The filter relies on additional infrastructure at your site. Here are some 
		general prerequisites that, if fulfilled, will lead to a smooth, successful 
		installation.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Define a Default Web site for IIS Instance ID 1 and verify that it is running. 
                                The installer requires that IIS instance ID 1 is defined and running. (Yes, this
                                can be an onerous prerequisite, which we intend to change in a future release.) 
                                Also, on IIS 6.0, verify that the Default application pool is running.</p>
			<li>
				<p>Determine the location of your site's Pubcookie login server. The installer 
				needs this URL during installation. You may also want to find out its version, 
				so that you know what features it supports.</p>
			<li>
				<p>Determine the location of your site's Pubcookie keyserver. The installer needs 
				this URL to download your site's Pubcookie "granting" certificate and to request 
				a symmetric encryption key that your server will share with 
				your login server. Depending on the keyserver version and site policy, you may 
				also need to ask your administrator to "permit" your server to request keys.</p>
			<li>
				<p>Determine how trust is handled by your site's Pubcookie keyserver. You'll need 
				to know which Certificate Authorities the keyserver trusts to verify 
				certificates. Similarly, you'll need to know which Certificate Authority can 
				verify the keyserver's certificate. Ask your administrator for guidelines; 
				it'll save you time and effort.</p>
		</ul>

		<p>Note: Review the sections on <a href="#vhosts">multiple web site configuration</a> or
                <a href="#clusters">clustered host configuration</a> now if either of those scenarios apply. 
		The information will help you think about and tailor the installation as 
		needed.</p>

		<h4><a name="sysreq">System Requirements</a></h4>

		<p>The Pubcookie ISAPI filter has the following system requirements:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Microsoft Windows 2000 or later</p>
			<li>
				<p>Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 or later</p>
			<li>
				<p>Accurate system time</p>
			<li>
				<p>Domain name registered in DNS (e.g. <i>appserver.example.edu</i>).</p>
			<li>
				<p>An SSL enabled web site. All intended users should be able to reach your website 
				via HTTPS at your registered DNS name without errors.</p>
			<li>
				<p>The <tt>System32\inetsrv</tt> folder should be world writable or writable by the 
				administrator account running the installer.</p>
			<li>
				<p>After installation, the IUSR account must be able to read and execute 
 				<tt>System32\inetsrv\Pubcookie\PubCookieFilter.dll</tt>.</p>
		</ul>

		<h4><a name="install">Installing Pubcookie</a></h4>

                <p>This section describes how to install Pubcookie using the provided Windows Installer package 
                (Pubcookie.msi). We'll cover a fairly typical installation and note significant exceptions and more
                advanced uses when possible.</p>

		<ol>

			<li>
                        	<p>Log in as Administrator or as an account with administrator privileges.
				The installer needs to be able to create folders and files in <tt>System32\inetsrv</tt>,
				to stop and start system services, to modify the Windows registry, and to read private keys in 
				the Windows certificate store.

				<p>Note: The installer can be run from the command prompt, or from within a batch file,
				with pre-defined site information. See the <a href="#msiexec">msiexec options</a> section
				for details.

			<li>
				<p>Run the Pubcookie.msi installer. Click Next on the initial Welcome screen.

				<p><img src="images/welcome.jpg">

				<p>Note: If the installer says, mysteriously, <i>"The wizard was interrupted before Pubcookie3 could
                                be completely installed"</i>, click Finish and run it again. (See Installer errors in the
                                <a href="#problems">Known Problems</a> section below.)</p>


			<li>
				<p>Pubcookie is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. 
				If you accept the terms of the license, select the appropriate radio button and click Next.

				<p><img src="images/license.jpg">

			<li>
				<p>The Site Information screen lets you enter your server name, login server and
				keyserver locations, authentication flavors, and lets you select your desired
				keyclient behavior. Enter your Site Information and click Next.

				<p><img src="images/siteinfo.jpg">

				<p>Note: Your server name should match the Common Name of your site's SSL certificate.

			<li>
				<p>The Custom Setup screen lets you choose what to install and where to install it. 
				By default, the filter and sample web application are selected, with fairly
				standard installation locations. Adjust as needed and click Next.

				<p><img src="images/custom.jpg">


			<li>
				<p>The Ready screen indicates the installer is ready. Read through the steps below
				to learn what it's going to do. It will display a Status bar, and provide a Cancel
				button which is fairly good at rolling things back out, but this is the stage where 
				installation really begins. When you're ready to proceed, click the Install button. 

				<p><img src="images/ready.jpg">

			<li>
				<p>Installation begins by adding Pubcookie to the Root Filter list in the IIS Metabase.
				If you instead want to add Pubcookie to specific web sites, use the Internet Information
				Services (IIS) Manager to do so after installation. (Hereafter referred to as the
				IIS Manager, you can find it at Start &gt; Programs &gt; Administrative Tools.)

				<p>Installation also adds your Site Information to the Windows registry
				as your initial Pubcookie configuration settings and installs a MMC snap-in
				that adds Pubcookie configuration tabs to Properties dialogs within 
				the IIS Manager.

                                <p>Note: See Installer errors in the <a href="#problems">Known Problems</a> section 
                                below if the installer is interrupted during installation.</p>

			<li>
				<p>Next, your IIS Service will be stopped.

			<li>
				<p>The installer will now run the keyclient according to the behavior you
				selected on the Site Information screen. The default behavior is to request your site's
				granting certificate and generate a new key, both of which are saved to a new
				<tt>System32\inetsrv\Pubcookie\keys\</tt> folder. Click OK on the corresponding
				pop-up messages from the keyclient.

				<p>Note: The keyclient must find a certicate and private key in your
				Personal certificate store that matches the server name entered in the Site
				Information screen. It uses this key pair to negotiate a secure SSL/TLS authenticated 
				connection to your keyserver. This connection depends not only on your certificate 
				and the Certificate Authority that issued your certificate,
				but also on the Certificate Authority that issued your keyserver's certificate.

				<p>Note: If the keyclient fails, you'll need to re-run it after the installer finishes.

			<li>
				<p>Next, your IIS Service will be started.

				<p>[fixme: do we mention here that the filter is initialized and a new session key pair 
				is generated?]
		
			<li>
				<p>When the installer has completed, click Finish.

				<p><img src="images/finish.jpg">

		</ol>

		<h4><a name="iis6">Web Service Extension Configuration (IIS 6.0)</a></h4>

		<p>Installation on IIS 6.0 requires additional configuration to add and allow
		a new Web Service Extension for Pubcookie. 

		<ol>

			<li>
			<p>Using the IIS Manager, select Web Service Extensions and click 
			"Add a new Web service extension..."

			<p><img src="images/webservicesext.jpg">

			<li>
			<p>On the New Web Service Extension dialog, enter <tt>.pubcookie3</tt> for the Extension name,
			click Add..., click Browse and browse to and then Open the <tt>System32\inetsrv\pubcookie\PubCookieFilter.dll</tt>,
			click OK, then check the box to Set extension status to Allowed, and click OK.

			<p><img src="images/addextdialog.jpg">

			<li>
			<p>The resulting Web Service Extension for Pubcookie will be added to the list.
			The Status should be Allowed.
			<p><img src="images/addedext.jpg">

		</ol>

		<h4><a name="review">Reviewing Pubcookie Installation</a></h4>

		<p>A successful installation of Pubcookie includes the following items:</p>

		<ul>

			<li>
			<p><b>ISAPI filter.</b> See IIS Master Properties &gt; Edit &gt; ISAPI Filters. Status 
			should be up/green; priority should be Low.

			<li>
			<p><b>ISAPI extension.</b> See IIS Master Properties &gt; Edit &gt; Home Directory &gt;
			Configuration... &gt; Application Mappings. A <tt>.pubcookie3</tt> Extension

		</ul>

		<h4><a name="config">Pubcookie Configuration Overview</a></h4>

                <p>Pubcookie derives its behavior from configuration settings in the Windows registry.
		Use the IIS Manager to view and manage these settings. They fall into two categories,
		<i>Pubcookie Server Values</i> and <i>Pubcookie Directives</i>.

		<p>Pubcookie Server Values apply configuration behaviors to Pubcookie itself.
		They can be found under your master or web site properties. Click the Pubcookie
		Server Values tab.

		<p>Pubcookie Directives apply configuration behaviors to specific resources: web sites,
		folders, even individual files. They can be found under the resource properties.
		Click the Pubcookie Directives tab.

		<h4><a name="auth">How to Configure Authentication</a></h4>

		<p>Use the IIS Manager to apply Pubcookie authentication to a resource. For example,
		if you installed the sample web application, follow these steps to view and modify
		how its configured for authentication:

		<ol>

			<li>
			<p>Browse to the Webapp in the IIS Manager and open its Properties.

			<li>
			<p>Select the Pubcookie Directives tab and choose the AuthType
			directive from the drop-down menu. 

			<li>
			<p>To enable authentication, select the appropriate value. To disable authentication, select None.

			<p><img src="images/mmcwebapp.jpg">

			<p>Note: AuthType values are determined by the Authentication Flavor
			Names entered during installation. They
			correspond with the types (or, technically, <i>flavors</i>) of authentication provided
			by your Pubcookie login server. Typically, just one flavor is 
			supported, but some sites have two or more. The menu values are stored as 
			Pubcookie Server Values.

			<li>
			<p>When you click Apply (or click OK, after making more than one change within the
			Properties dialog), your configuration choices will be written to the appropriate
			registry key.

			<p><img src="images/registrywebapp.jpg">

			<li>
			<p>The filter reads the AuthType value on every request, so configuration changes 
			should be reflected immediately.

		<h4><a name="keyclient">Running Keyclient.exe</a></h4>

		<p>The Pubcookie keyclient for Windows (<tt>System32\inetsrv\pubcookie\keyclient.exe</tt>) 
		is used to securely obtain symmetric encryption keys for your server name(s). It uses the
		SSPI/SChannel libraries to negotiate a SSL/TLS authenticated connection to the 
		keyserver, using credentials and trusted certificate authority (CA) information
		from the Windows certificate store. Most likely it will use the same Server (SSL)
		Certificate used by IIS for secure HTTPS communications.

		<p>The keyclient supports the following command-line options:

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p><tt>-H &lt;hostname&gt;</tt> (Client hostname. Used to search certificate store
			for a certificate with a matching SubjectAltName or Subject/CN.)

			<li>
			<p><tt>-K &lt;location&gt;</tt> (Key Server URL; defaults to Keymgt_URI registry setting.)

			<li>
			<p><tt>-d</tt> (Download current key; without this option it will obtain a new key.)

			<li>
			<p><tt>-G</tt> (Obtain your site's Pubcookie granting certificate.)

			<li>
			<p><tt>-I</tt> (Run in simplified installer mode. )

		</ul>

		<p>For example, to request a host key for <i>appserver.exampled.edu</i> from
		<i>login.example.edu</i>, you would use the <tt>-H</tt> and <tt>-K</tt> options.

<pre>&gt; cd C:\WINNT\system32\inetsrv\pubcookie
&gt; keyclient.exe -H appserver.example.edu -K https://login.example.edu:2222 </pre>

		<p>Note: The keyclient skips over expired certificates in its search for one
		that matches the specified (<tt>-H</tt>) hostname.

		<p>Note: When run from the command prompt, the keyclient will allow you to
		pick which certificate to use if it finds more than one that matches.

		<h4><a name="clusters">Clustered Host Configuration</a></h4>

		<p>If the same server name is hosted on several machines, you have a <i>clustered host configuration</i>
		and will need to synchronize your installation and configuration among the cluster members. In
		particular, you need to make sure each member has a copy of the same host key and is using
		the same Pubcookie session key pair.

		<ol>

			<li>
			<p>To synchronize the host key, when you run the installer on the first host, set
			the installer's keyclient behavior to obtain a new key. On subsequent hosts, set it to
			retrieve the old key. Another method is to obtain a new host key on the very last host and then
			copy it to the previous hosts. 

			<li>
			<p>To ensure each cluster member has the same session key pair, put the same
                	key pair on each host, on disk, in the right location, and the filter will read it 
	                upon startup. The file names are
			<tt>System32\inetsrv\Pubcookie\keys\pubcookie_session.cert</tt> and
			<tt>System32\inetsrv\Pubcookie\keys\pubcookie_session.key</tt>, respectively.

			<p>Note: any appropriately named key pair in PEM format will suffice for the session key pair. 
			The difficulty on Windows is generating a key pair. If you can find a system 
			that has OpenSSL, you can generate a new key pair with:

<pre>$ openssl req -new -x509 -out pubcookie_session.cert \
-newkey rsa:1024 -nodes -keyout pubcookie_session.key</pre>

			<p>[fixme: there must be an easier way using Windows crypto API commands.]

			<li>
			<p>As a result of this effort, each host will have the same contents in its Pubcookie keys folder.</p>
			<p><img src="images/clusterkeysfolder.jpg">
		</ol>


		<p>Note: If you don't sychronize clustered hosts, session cookies set by one cluster member will not be 
		readable by the other cluster members, resulting in <i>Can't unbundle session cookie</i> error
		messages in the Event log.

		<h4><a name="vhosts">Multiple Web Site Configuration</a></h4>

		<p>If a machine hosts multiple web sites (server names), additional configuration may
		be required.

		<ol>
			<li>
			<p>(Required) Since each web site represents a differnet server name, each
			web site must obtain a host key from the keyserver. Install Pubcookie
			for one site. Then <a href="#keyclient">run the keyclient</a> again (using
			the <tt>-H hostname</tt> option) for each additional web site. Reset IIS
			when you're done.

			<li>
			<p>(Recommended) By default the filter reads all configuration settings 
			starting from the main PubcookieFilter registry key. If two different web sites
			have different configuration objectives, then you may run into conflicts. 
			For example, one site might have authentication enabled at the root level,
			while a second site might enable it only for a subfolder. You can't
			do both, since the AuthType settings will conflict. Therefore, you should
			separate configuration such that each web site has its own location for
			configuration settings:

			<ol>

			<li>
			<p>Using the IIS Manager, open the Properties for each web site.

			<li>
			<p>Select the Pubcookie Server Values tab and choose the WebVarLocation variable 
			from the drop-down menu.

			<li>
			<p>Enter a new registry location for the WebVarLocation. You might base the name on the web site (e.g.
                        <tt>System\CurrentControlSet\Services\PubcookieFilter\DefaultWebSite</tt>).

			<p><img src="images/mmcwebvarlocation.jpg">

			<li>
			<p>Notice that your web site's IIS Instance ID maps to the WebVarLocation. You can see
			this in the Window registry.

			<p><img src="images/registrywebvarlocation.jpg">

			<li>
			<p>Once a WebVarLocation has been defined for a site, all <i>new</i> configuration changes
			will be represented under the new registry location.

			</ol>

		</ol>

		<h4><a name="msiexec">Pubcookie Installer Msiexec Options</a></h4>

		<p>The Windows Installer package for Pubcookie supports several command-line options
		that can be used with the msiexec command.

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p><tt>LOGINURI</tt> (Login Server URL)

			<li>
			<p><tt>KEYMGTURI</tt> (Key Server URL)

			<li>
			<p><tt>AUTHID1-3</tt> (Authentication Flavor Names; Use "" for unused flavors.)

			<li>
			<p><tt>RUNKEYCLIENT</tt> (Keyclient Behavior. 0=Do not run keyclient; 1=Obtain new key (default); 2=Retrieve old key)

		</ul>

		<p>For example, you might run it at the command prompt, first changing folders to wherever
		you saved Pubcookie.msi.

<pre>&gt; cd C:\WINNT\system32\inetsrv\pubcookie
&gt; msiexec /i pubcookie.msi \
    LOGINURI=https://login.example.edu \
    KEYMGTURI=https://login.example.edu:2222 \
    AUTHID1=EGNETID AUTHID2="" AUTHID3="" \
    RUNKEYCLIENT=1</pre>

		<h4><a name="upgrade">Upgrading</a></h4>

		<p>[fixme: This is draft text. We need more real-world experience to confirm that 
		this section is accurate.]

		<p>The Windows installer package requires you to uninstall previous versions prior
		to installing a newer version.

		<ol>
		<li>
		<p>Run the installer for the version of Pubcookie currently installed on your
		system, e.g. if you're using version 3.1.1 run the Pubcookie 3.1.1 installer.

		<li>
		<p>Choose the Remove option from the Program Maintenance screen, click Next, and
		click Remove. This will uninstall the current version while perserving your 
		current Pubcookie keys folder and your current configuration settings for alternate 
		WebVarLocations and web resources (i.e. web instances, folders and files).

		<p>Note: uninstalling Pubcookie removes the root level configuration settings for the 
		filter (i.e. Pubcookie Server Variables). These settings will be added back, based
		on the Site Information you provide, when you install the newer version.

		<li>
		<p>Once you have uninstalled the current version of Pubcookie, run the new installer.
		It will install Pubcookie as if from scratch, perserving your current Pubcookie keys
		folder and configuration settings.

		<p>Note: Enter the same Authentication Flavor Names to ensure that current AuthType
		configurations work the same as before. If you change your Authentication Flavor
		Names, resources that currently require authentication may not be protected
		anymore.

		<p>Note: The safest keyclient behavior to choose during an upgrade is to not run the keyclient.
		This leaves your keys folder unchanged. Retrieving the existing key is a safe choice too.

		<p>Note: The installer will remove old versions of the filter from
		the IIS metabase, but this generally isn't as effective as uninstalling things first.

		</ol>

		<h4><a name="uninstall">Uninstalling Pubcookie</a></h4>

		<p>[fixme: TBD. need to document effects to each installed item.]

		<h4><a name="problems">Known Problems</a></h4>

		<p>Known problems with the Windows components in Pubcookie 3.3.1:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p><b>Windows Installer errors.</b> Pubcookie.msi is a rudimentary Windows installer package, so
                        you might run into some quirks. It isn't understood why it sometimes doesn't proceed beyond the
                        Welcome screen and says <i>"The wizard was interrupted before Pubcookie3 could be completely
                        installed."</i> Be persistent here. Re-running the installer often enables it to proceed. (If
                        you understand why, let us know.) The installer can also fail due to other reasons. If a web site
                        is not defined and running for IIS Instance ID 1 (often the Default Web site) it will say: 
                        <i>"Could not find a web site. Make sure that a web site has been defined in the Computer 
                        Management MMC snap-in."</i> In IIS 6.0, if the Default application pool isn't started, the
                        installer might say <i>"The wizard was interrupted before Pubcookie 3 could be completely
                        installed..."</i> and roll back the installation.</p>

			<li>
			<p><b>Memory leaks.</b> Memory leaks have been observed on systems using the filter, causing the
			inetinfo.exe (IIS 5) and w3wp.exe (IIS 6) processes to grow over time. This can be addressed on
			heavily loaded systems by recycling sites or resetting IIS nightly, in which case it is 
			recommended that you store your Pubcookie session key pair on disk (see <a
			href="#clusters">clustered host	configuration</a>) to preserve sessions between restarts.</p>

			<li>
			<p><b>IIS 6.0 Idle Timeout causes session errors.</b> Uncheck idle timeouts to prevent session errors.
                        The default inactivity timeout in IIS 6 is 20 minutes for each web application pool (see Properties > 
                        Performance > Idle timeout). When this times out, it's like resetting IIS, which causes the filter 
			to reinitialize and generate a new session key (if you don't have one on disk). The new session key can't
                        be used to read old session cookies, so users who establish a session before the
                        timeout/reinitialization receive error messages. They manifest themselves as <i>Can't unbundle session
                        cookie</i> messages in the Event Log.</p>

			<li>
			<p><b>New Event Log sources not added for new Web Sites.</b> If a new Web Site is added after Pubcookie has
                        been installed, a new Event Log source may need to be registered manually.</p>

			<li>
			<p><b>MMC adds empty registry keys.</b> The MMC extension adds empty, harmless, but nevertheless
                        extraneous registry keys when you open the Pubcookie Directives tab.</p>

			<li>
			<p><b>MMC can't set inherited settings.</b> The MMC extension won't allow you to override inherited values with
                        the same value that's being inherited.</p>

			<li>
			<p><b>Windows Event Viewer crashes.</b> Past versions of the pbc_messages DLL are known to crash the Event Viewer
                        on some systems when viewing Pubcookie events. This <i>should</i> be fixed in version 3.3, so please report it if it still happens.</p>

			<li>
			<p><b>Requests to root level resources require a trailing slash.</b> Requests to folders and virtual
                        directories at the root level of a site require a trailing slash. Without it, the filter uses
                        the default configuration and doesn't pick up the settings specific to the folder or virtual
                        directory. Until this is fixed in the filter, links and requests should always include the trailing slash.
                        (But that's good form anyway.)
		</ul>

		<h4><a name="certs">Appendix A: Windows Certificate Store</a></h4>

		<p>The Windows certificate store holds the SSL key pairs used by IIS and the
		Pubcookie keyclient. You can use the MMC Certificate snap-in to view and manage
		these certificates.

		<ol>
			<li>
			<p>Open the MMC console by clicking Start > Run

			<li>
			<p>Type mmc and click OK.

			<li>
			<p>On the Console menu, click Add/Remove Snap-in.

			<li>
			<p>Click Add > Certificates. You'll be asked to select from the
			current user account, service account, or the computer account.

			<li>
			<p>Choose the Computer account, which is where the relevant certificates
			are stored.

			<li>
			<p>Click Local computer, and then click OK.

			<li>
			<p>Use the MMC to review the certicates in the Personal container.
			Remove any certificates that do not belong.
