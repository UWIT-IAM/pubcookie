Here are a top level steps for a successful pubcookie installation
at a new site.  Not all steps may apply to your installation.

 1. Allocate some host resources.  You can test pubcookie with one machine
    operating as a login server and an application server but it's nice to 
    seperate them.  Also, to demonstrate single signon it's nice to hav
    different test applications on different machines.

 2. Get and install OpenSSL, most recent version usually recommended.

 3. Get and install Apache with SSL, will probably require mod_ssl.  This will 
    be for the login server and any Apache application webservers you will use.
    The login webserver could be any webserver software that runs CGI's but
    anything beyond Apache is uncharted waters.

 4. If you will be using pubcookie on an IIS server, get and install that.

 5. Download the pubcookie software from:

        http://www.washington.edu/computing/pubcookie/ext/download.html
	
    The distribution files are:
    	pubcookie_login-nn.nn.tar.gz	- the login server software
        cgic1.07-pubcookien.nn.tar.gz	- a library required for the login server
	mod_pubcookie-nn.nn.tar.gz	- the apache module, source
	iis_pubcookie-nn.nn.exe		- the iisapi filter, dll and source

    The pubcookie_login and mod_pubcookie hav a README.txt file that lists
    the files that should be in the distributions.  We recommend checking
    the file list before proceeding.

 6. Build and install the login server.  See INSTALL.LOGIN.

 7. Build and install either or both the Apache module or/and IISAPI filter.
    
    for the Apache module see :

    http://www.washington.edu/computing/pubcookie/apache/install.html

    for the IISAPI filter see:

    http://www.washington.edu/computing/pubcookie/iis/install.html

 8. Test.  There will a document forthcoming that outlines a nice 
    test environment.
 
 9. Enjoy.
