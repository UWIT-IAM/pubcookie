This is what exists of a pubcookie coding style guide.

This is an effort to hav consistant formatting in the pubcookie source (if
not consistant spelling).  Currently some of the indenting and white space 
isn't consistant, even in the same file.  As i go i'm trying to iron out 
any inconsistancies.

This is not carved in stone but alot has already been traced out so unless it's
worth changing it's easist to stick to this.

- indentions are four spaces (not a tab)
- there should be a space between statement operators and their parantentisis
e.g. "if (blah)" not "if(blah)"
- use whitespace generiously.
