Introduction

The Pubcookie login server has two primary functions; to authenticate user
sessions and to issue authentication tokens that may be used by other Pubcookie
components.  The login server authenticates users either by checking user
provided credentials via an authentication service (Kerberos, SecurID,
...) or by verifying a token that was created on a previous visit to the
login server.  Example code to interface to an authentication system is
provided.

Implementation

The login server uses a binary CGI, compiled from C, to process requests.  
This CGI is the Pubcookie only active component on the login server.  The login
server runs Apache webserver, however other webserver software that
supports SSL and CGI would probably work.  Due to the nature of the login
server only other apps that receive a high level of security scrutiny
should be run on the login server.

The login cgi displays the web page where users are asked to enter
credentials as well as web pages displaying any errors.

Authentication services

Pubcookie has a very simple interface for talking to authentication services
There is a sample authentication module provied.  Additionally there is a 
module for Kerberos 5.  

Internal to the login.cgi support for multiple and various authentication services is 
not very flexable and will be revised in the futue.

Compiling

The login cgi uses the CGIC library for some functions.  This library is
included with the Pubcookie distribution.  
Pubcookie uses a modified CGIC library.  Currently cgic comes in a seperate 
tar file and is compiled seperately.  The pubcookie modifications should
not affect other expected uses of cgic, the modifications simply make some 
cgic-internal functions available to external apps.
 
To compile cgic, untar the pubcookie_cgic.tar.gz into a seperate directory.
Check the Makefile for installation specific stuff and type 'make'.  libcgic.a and cgic.h can be put in the pubcookie install directory or other locations 
you please.

Once cigc is compiled you can build the index.cgi with Makefile.index.cgi

Key Management (as it is)

Current key management in pubcookie is a simple shared key hashed to the 
host's ip.  There is no current mechanism for revoking a key or forcing
a new generation of keys.
	
For the initial install use mkc_make_generic to make a master key.  this 
master key is then hashed to the host ip's via the mkc_make_local tool.  

Anciliary Tools

Tools that you need for key management:
mkc_make_local - 'localizes' master crypt key for a specific host (ip).
new client hosts will need a localized key.
mkc_make_generic - Makes a blob of bits that can be used for a master c_key.

Tool rarely used for debugging:
test_local_c_key

Obsolete tools that might be handy for debugging:
pbc_create - creates a pubcookie cookie, see src for usage.
pbc_verify - decrypts/verifys/displays pubcookie cookies.
