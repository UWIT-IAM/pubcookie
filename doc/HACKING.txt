Summary:  This is what exists of a Pubcookie hacking & coding guide.

1) Code Style

Here are some guidelines for writing code in the Pubcookie style:

    * use four spaces for indentation -- not a tab

    * use a space between statement operators and their parentheses
         e.g. "if (blah)" not "if(blah)"

    * use whitespace generously

    * wrap lines at 75 characters

    * braces for statements should start on the same line as the statement.

    * braces for functions should start on a new line.

    * document your functions using Doxygen comments:
         http://www.stack.nl/%7Edimitri/doxygen/

    * style is tidied by "indent -gnu -i4 -npsl -bad -br -ce -nut -l75"

2) Logging in mod_pubcookie

Logging in mod_pubcookie should be done with an ap_log_error() or
ap_log_rerror() call, depending on whether you have a request (r) or
server (s) record handy. Note: ap_log_rerror() logs the client ip.

    Examples:

    ap_log_rerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_NOERRNO|AP_LOG_DEBUG, r,
        "pubcookie_user: has granting; current uri is: %s\n", r->uri);

    ap_log_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_NOERRNO|AP_LOG_DEBUG, s,
        "pubcookie_user: has granting; current uri is: %s\n", r->uri);

    Levels:

    AP_LOG_EMERG - things are really broken, can't go on, bail
    AP_LOG_INFO  - normal logging of redirects and the like
    AP_LOG_DEBUG - super-debug or other really verbose crap
