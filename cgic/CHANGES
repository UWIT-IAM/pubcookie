This version of CGIC is derived from Tom Boutell's CGIC and has been modified
for use with pubcookie.  Here's somewhat of a version history

cgic1.07pubcookie1.01 - new name.  fixes from CMU.  mostly to catch printing
	unitialized variables. 

cgic1.07UW - originally modified version, exports parsing of cgi args.
