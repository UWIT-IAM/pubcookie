This version of CGIC is derived from Tom Boutell's CGIC and has been modified
for use with pubcookie.  Here's somewhat of a version history

cgic.c/rev1.4 - Fixed bug that caused granting request parsing problems
(for referring URLs with no "name=value" args), which particularly affect
session reauth. (Bug diagnosed and reported by Todd Ross.)

cgic1.07pubcookie1.01 - new name. fixes from CMU. mostly to catch
printing unitialized variables.

cgic1.07UW - originally modified version, exports parsing of cgi args.
