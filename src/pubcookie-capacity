The way i've been thinking about pubcookie capacity requirements is the   
following, and this would be a good time to discuss it.  If we assume a
campus community of 80,000 and 75% of them come to work/school/lab during
the same hour, equally distibuted across that hour.  During that hour they
login and visit three apps.  So, we're looking at 3000 login loops per   
minute or 50 per second.
