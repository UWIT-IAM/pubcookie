These files are in RCS.  Sample of editing one:

cd /afs/.andrew/data/db/pubcookie/pubcookie_login_templates
co -l README
-- do  your edits
ci -u README

If you edit these files with a html editor (frontpage,
dreamweaver, etc) they wont work anymore.
These files are templates used by the pubcookie login program.

They are not valid html as they are written, for one (or both) of these
reasons:

*** some files contain HTTP server headers 
*** editing them with visual tools looses or garbles them

Most files here begin with QUOTE
Pragma: No-Cache                                
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate 
Expires: Sat, 1 Jan 2000 01:01:01 GMT                        
Content-Type: text/html

Note the extra blank line after the headers.  These are HTTP headers.


*** some files are snipits of html the login program stiches together
*** editing them with a tool will added <html> and <body> tags that
*** will conflict

These files taken together are the login screen the user sees.  There are two %s in them.
Thats to print out the status info (like password incorrect try again sort of stuff).
Between part1 and part2 the login program sticks in a pile of hidden fields so it can
keep track of its private info about this request.  So part1 needs to end in the form
that gets submited on login.  part2 is the rest of the file

login_part1
login_part2

This file is used when a login is successfull and we need to redirect back to the client web server.
nonpost_redirect

If the login program is giving up this if for the error messages.  You shouldnt see this normaly (as normnal errors go back to the login page).  If you want to see what it looks like then create a new browser (not a new window but start a browser from scratch so it has no pubcookie cookies).  Then go to https://blackboard-login.andrew.cmu.edu you will get an error because it has no idea how you got there.

*** still to come handling of posts from client web servers ***
