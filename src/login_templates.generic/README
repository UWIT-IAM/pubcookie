*** some files are snipits of html the login program stiches together
*** editing them with a tool will add <html> and <body> tags that
*** will conflict (eventually we want to fix this)

login_part1
login_part2
   These files taken together are the login screen the user sees.
   There are two %s in them.  Those %s are to print out the status
   info (like "password incorrect, try again").  Between part1 and
   part2 the login program sticks in a pile of hidden fields so it can
   keep track of its private info about this request.  So part1 needs
   to end in the form that gets submited on login.  part2 is the rest
   of the file


nonpost_redirect
   This file is used when a login is successful and we need to redirect
   back to the client web server.  

notok_part1
notok_part2
   If the login program is giving up, these files are used for error
   messages.  You shouldn't see this normally, as normnal errors
   should return to the login page.
   xxx what's a good way of getting pubcookie to display these pages?

notok_need_ssl
   displayed when the login.cgi is invoked from a non-protected
   connection

logout_postscript_still_weblogin
logout_still_weblogin
logout_time_remaining
   xxx

status_part1
status_part2
   xxx

error
   displayed when the login flavor has decided that not only has this
   authentication failed, but further authentications are extremely
   likely to fail. you might want to include a "try again" link on
   this page, but might also want to instruct users to call for more
   information.
