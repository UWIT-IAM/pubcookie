In testing the installation of the Pubcookie IIS ISAPI filter,
PubcookieFilter, I just realized that there's an easier way to plug
in LDAP as the user authentication backend in the Login server.
Here's a brief how:

  1. Replace the original index.cgi_krb.c file in pubcookie_login-1.22
     with the index.cgi_ldap.c from my previous pubcookie-uh-ldap.zip
     file.  So, inside index.cgi_krb.c it has the index.cgi_ldap.c
     code.

  2. Rename auth_ldap function to auth_krb in the new index.cgi_krb.c
     in step 1.

  3. Compile and install the Login server.

This should minimize the changes you'd need to do index.cgi.c since
you can take your previously modified installation of the Pubcookie
distribution that you've customized for your site just do the above
steps.  Performing the above steps effectively changes the UWNetID
authentication method so that it use LDAP.  What I did was add a new
authentication type which let me retain the Kerberos authentication
identified as UWNetID.

Hope this helps a bit more,
Russ
