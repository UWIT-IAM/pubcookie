  VERIFIERS

  a verifier is the backend of the login cgi.  it checks a
  username/password combination and returns a YES or a NO.

  some verifiers may also support credentials.  the credentials
  returned with a YES answer represent the "master" credentials for
  this user, good for the rest of the login-cookie session.

  the login server may save the master credentials (by encoding 'str'
  into a cookie with suitable protection) and later derive delegatable
  credentials from them using credentials_derive() for that verifier.
