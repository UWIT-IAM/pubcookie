    <p>Notes: </p>
    <p>1) &quot;Help&quot; and &quot;Andrew UserID&quot; and maybe &quot;Andrew Password&quot; should take you to a page telling you to ONLY enter your userid, not @andrew.cmu.edu, use all lowercase... it would be nice to automatically take off @andrew.cmu.edu or lowercase the userid. I have restricted the Andrew UserID field to 8 characters, since ids are limited to 8 characters :-) ...</p>
    <p>2) Forgot your password should tell people the two ways of resetting passwords: Fax the help center a copy of a photo id with signature, userid, and a contact method. Or stop into the Help Center with a valid photoid.</p>
    <p>3) I've asked John to double the size of the Scottie Dog head. :-)</p>
