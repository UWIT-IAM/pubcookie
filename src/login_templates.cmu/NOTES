1) "Help" and "Andrew UserID" and maybe "Andrew Password" should take
you to a page telling you to ONLY enter your userid, not
@andrew.cmu.edu, use all lowercase... it would be nice to
automatically take off @andrew.cmu.edu or lowercase the userid. I have
restricted the Andrew UserID field to 8 characters, since ids are
limited to 8 characters :-) ...

2) Forgot your password should tell people the two ways of resetting
passwords: Fax the help center a copy of a photo id with signature,
userid, and a contact method. Or stop into the Help Center with a
valid photoid.

3) I've asked John to double the size of the Scottie Dog head. :-)
